  '.\lot\x\block': 1
  '.\lot\x\page': 1
...

Use this extension to show all of the visible pages in a single page content as a link list.

### Basic Usage

Put this block in the desired page content you want to display the link list to:

~~~ .txt
[‌[‌archive‌]‌]
~~~

### Advance Usage

#### Sorting

By default, this extension will display the list of pages sorted ascending by its title. If you add `time` attribute with value `true` or a time pattern, then each list item will be completed with page publication time, and list order will be made based on the page publication time:

~~~ .txt
[‌[‌archive time="true"‌]‌]

[‌[‌archive time="%Y/%m/%d"‌]‌]
~~~

#### Folder Selection

You can also limit the list output by determining the folder path relative to `PAGE`. This is useful for creating archive page by category:

~~~ .yaml

### Articles

[‌[‌archive path="/article"‌]‌]

### Extensions

[‌[‌archive path="/reference/extension"‌]‌]
~~~

#### Nesting Level

The maximum recursion value is `4` by default, but you can specify another number. Determining value `0` will deactivate the recursive list feature:

~~~ .txt
[‌[‌archive deep="0"‌]‌]
~~~
